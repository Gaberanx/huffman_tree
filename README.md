# huffman_tree
A working huffman tree for text files.

This program uses a huffman tree data structure to interact with local text files. This was made for .txt files and was intended to run on a Windows operating system.

The main program is in the TextFileHuffmanTree.java file and the code for the object nodes of the huffman tree were written in the TreeNode.java file.
