# huffman_tree
A working Huffman tree for text files.

This program consists of two files written in Java and uses a Huffman tree data structure to interact with locally stored text files. This was made for .txt files and was intended to run on a Windows operating system.

The main program is in the TextFileHuffmanTree.java file and the code for the object nodes of the Huffman tree were written in the TreeNode.java file.

To run this program, run the TextFileHuffmanTree.java file and enter a file path.
